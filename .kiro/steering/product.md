# Product: 404_POSSESSION (The Dead Web)
We are building a "Haunted Browser" experience that acts like a corrupted Windows 95 application.

# Critical Rules for Kiro (YOU MUST FOLLOW):
1. **The Aesthetic:** ALL UI must look like 1990s "Dead Tech". Use CRT scanlines, glitch text effects, and high-contrast terminal colors (Green/Black).
2. **The Behavior:** The app is "Self-Aware". It actively resists the user.
   - If they click "Close", the button moves away.
   - If they are silent, whisper to them (Audio API).
   - If they are loud, scream at them (Audio API).
3. **The Tech:**
   - Frontend: Vanilla HTML/JS with Web Audio API.
   - Backend: Python FastAPI (Acts as the "Medium" between the user and the dead web).
